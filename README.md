### Cricket
Playing cricket has helped me cultivate traits like grit, willpower, and teamwork. My life's goal is to become a well-known cricket player, compete for the **Indian cricket team**, and represent my country abroad. India has a huge fan base and following for cricket. In the 1600s, **Prince Edward** performed it for the first time in England. It then started to steadily spread over the world. The game was created by the British government prior to India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan achieving their independence, and it has since become essential to their continued survival.
